This mapgen mod modifies how lava is distributed and how lava interacts with neighboring nodes in a variety of ways. Its various features can be enabled or disabled independently via configuration settings.

This mod makes magma more sparsely distributed across the map, but where it is found it will be available in massive quantities. Using this mod in conjunction with the dynamic_liquid mod can result in !!fun!! lava flows when caves intersect with magma conduits.

## Lava interaction with adjacent nodes

This mod provides a number of ABMs that cause nodes adjacent to lava to slowly convert into glowing "hot" forms, and then back to cool forms again if the lava goes away. Stone is converted into hot cobble and obsidian converts to a glowing red form.

Also included are ABMs that cause soil adjacent to lava to be cooked into barren sand, and coal and diamond ore to be cooked into cobble.

## Magma veins

Magma veins are lava-filled conduits that thread through the ground somewhat like a cave system. The veins have a bias toward vertical orientation but can curve and twist in any direction.

Magma veins can be optionally be lined with a layer of obsidian. The density of vein generation is configurable.

## Volcanoes

Volcanoes are large cone-shaped mountains formed from lava that rises through a central pipe. This mod can scatter randomly sized and shaped volcanoes across the map, with configurable spacing and probability. Volcanoes come in "extinct", "dormant" and "active" forms, and tall volcanoes can have a mantle of snow clinging to their peaks.
