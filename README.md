A relatively simple mapgen mod. It adds magma conduits that thread through the ground like a second vertically-oriented cave system.

It also has the following optional features, configurable via settings:

* Removes default mapgen lava (it leaves the empty caves behind)
* Removes surface lava that would otherwise spill out into the surrounding landscape, leaving stable lava pools dotted here and there.
* Adds an obsidian lining to magma conduits, providing a warning for unsuspecting miners
* Adds "glowing rock" that forms from stone and obsidian adjacent to magma, providing a brief warning to miners that they're about to hit trouble.

This mod makes magma more sparsely distributed across the map, but where it is found it will be available in massive quantities. Using this mod in conjunction with the dynamic_liquid mod can result in !!fun!! lava flows when caves intersect with magma conduits.
